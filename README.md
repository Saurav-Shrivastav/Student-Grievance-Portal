# Student-Grievance-Portal
Hello Everyone, Contributors to this project are [Aniket Biswas](https://github.com/aniketbiswas21), [Aryaman Grover](https://github.com/Aryaman1706), and [Saurav Shrivastav](https://github.com/Saurav-Shrivastav). 
We are making this project to ensure that every issue of the students in an institution is heard by the concerned authorities.
There are certain issues that we need to talk about and get them resolved but are either hesitant to take the issues to higher authorities or the authorities themselves ignore the issue due to lack of response of the students. 
Here is where our portal comes to the rescue. We have designed this portal where students can report an issue/grievance on the portal and other fellow students can upvote or downvote the issue/grievance as per their understanding/relevance. 
To monitor all these requests we would give special privileges to what we call "The Student Council". 
Once an issue/grievance is cross-checked by the students and the student council, the request would be forwarded to the concerned authorities and regular updates would be shared on the platform.

## Motivation
We initiated this project after attending a Bootcamp by Developer Student Club of Thapar University, Patiala.
